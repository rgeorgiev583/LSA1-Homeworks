#
# cryptpart -- encrypt Linux drive or partition using dm-crypt with LUKS
#

#
# Requirements:
#
# * Linux with dm-crypt support (obviously)
# * GRUB installed and set up as default bootloader
# * mkinitcpio -- for creating the new initial ramdisk environment
#

#
# Why dm-crypt?
#
# Because it:
#
# * enables you to achieve full control over all aspects of partition and key
#   management
# * is de-facto standard for the Linux kernel
# * ships with the default kernel (unlike loop-AES, which requires a
#   custom-built kernel configuration)
# * is block device encryption (see below) (unlike eCryptfs and EncFs, which
#   encrypt only files in an existing filesystem)
# * is implemented in kernelspace (=> fast, unlike EncFs, which resides in
#   userspace and uses FUSE => slow)
# * supports LUKS (see below), which is used to store metadata and encryption
#   key in a consistent manner (unlike the other methods, which do not support
#   LUKS, and store them in a variety of different places)
# * supports automounting on login
# * is the most secure method:
#   - supports a wide variety of ciphers:
#     AES, Anubis, CAST5/6, Twofish, Serpent, Camellia, Blowfish, â€¦
#     (practically every cipher the kernel Crypto API offers, unlike the other
#     methods, which only allow AES, *fish and/or Serpent)
#   - supports salting
#   - supports cascading multiple ciphers on block devices (unlike EncFS)
#   - supports key-slot diffusion
#   - protects against key-scrubbing
#   - supports multiple (independently revokable) keys for the same encrypted
#     data (unlike EncFS)
# * supports multithreading
# * supports hardware-accelerated encryption
# * supports support for (manually) resizing the encrypted block device
#   in-place (unlike TrueCrypt)
# * supports access of encrypted data from Windows
# * is used by the Debian/Ubuntu installer to encrypt the system partition
#   (where / is mounted), and by the Fedora installer
# * is still supported (unlike TrueCrypt, which isn't as of May 2014)
# * is licensed under the GPL (free as in freedom)
#
#
# Why LUKS?
#
# Because it:
# 
# * is an additional convenience layer
# * stores all of the needed setup information (cryptographic metadata and
#   wrapped encyption key) for dm-crypt on the disk itself
# * abstracts partition and key management in an attempt to improve ease of
#   use and cryptographic security
#
#
# Why block device encyption?
#
# Because it (unlike stacked filesystem encryption methods):
#
# * operates below the filesystem layer
# * makes sure that *everything* written to a certain block device (i.e. a
#   whole disk, or a partition, or a file acting as a virtual loop-back
#   device) is encrypted
# * doesn't care whether the content of the encrypted block device is a
#   filesystem, a partition table, a LVM setup, or anything else.
# * encrypts file metadata
# * allows for encryption of whole hard drives (including partition tables)
# * allows for encryption of swap space
#
# In contrast, stacked filesystem encryption methods add an additional layer
# to an existing filesystem, to automatically encrypt/decrypt files whenever
# they're written/read.

# Usage:
#
# cryptpart [ -n <device-mapper name> | -t <type> | -m <mountpoint> | -B | -C ]
#   <device>
#
# -n <device-mapper name>   - name of device to map partition/drive to
# -t <type>                 - device filesystem type
# -m <mountpoint>           - name of directory where to mount the encrypted
#                             device
# -B                        - do not configure bootloader (e.g. if not using
#                             GRUB)
# -C                        - do not configure anything (if you do not want
#                             persistence)
# -h                        - print usage information and exit
#
# <device>                  - drive or partition to encypt, e.g. /dev/sda or
#                             /dev/sdb1

# WARNING: The following code will only work with GRUB-based systems.  If you
#   use another bootloader, you have to do the following part yourself
#   (and you will also have to run this script with the `-b' parameter
#   enabled.)
# WARNING #2: This script also assumes that you have a separate /boot
#   partition mounted where GRUB is located.
# WARNING #3: The following WON'T work with GRUB legacy.  Please update your
#   system instead. :-)
#

# skip the following steps if `-C' flag is raised
if [ -n "$NO_CONFIG" ]; then
	return 0

#
# a) configure mkinitcpio:

# append hooks to mkinitcpio config file

#
# b) configure bootloader:
#

# a kernel parameter which instructs the kernel that $DEVICE is encrypted
#   and is mapped to $DEVMAPPER_NAME has to be passed at boot time
# so therefore append said kernel parameter to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
#   line in /etc/default/grub to make it run persistently at every boot
